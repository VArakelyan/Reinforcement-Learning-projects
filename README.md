Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository showcases a collection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects developed as part of the Reinforcement Learning course at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA). The projects focus on implementing, analyzing, and experimenting with key RL algorithms, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

Inspired by Sutton and Bartoâ€™s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, these projects cover a range of fundamental RL concepts, including policy learning, value estimation, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Projects Overview

ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning
Developed a Tic-Tac-Toe environment.
Designed a Reinforcement Learning agent that learns optimal strategies.
Enabled users to play against the trained AI, showcasing its learning progress.
ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Multi-Armed Bandit Problem
Explored the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the multi-armed bandit problem.
Implemented and compared various strategies:
Îµ-greedy algorithm
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
Gradient bandit algorithms
Analyzed the impact of Optimistic Initial Values vs. Realistic Initial Values.
