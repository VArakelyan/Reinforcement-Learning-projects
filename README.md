# **Reinforcement Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of **Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects** developed as part of the **Reinforcement Learning course** at the **National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA)**.  
Each project explores different RL algorithms and concepts, balancing **theoretical insights** with **practical implementation**.

Inspired by **Sutton and Barto’s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction**, these projects cover key areas such as **policy learning, value estimation, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs**.

## **📌 Projects Overview**

### **Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning**
- Developed a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game environment.
- Implemented a **Reinforcement Learning agent** capable of learning optimal strategies.
- Enabled users to play against the trained AI to observe its learning progress.

### **Project 2: Multi-Armed Bandit Problem**
- Investigated the **exploration-exploitation trade-off** in the **multi-armed bandit problem**.
- Implemented and compared strategies:
  - **ε-greedy algorithm**
  - **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**
  - **Gradient bandit algorithms**
- Analyzed the impact of **Optimistic Initial Values vs. Realistic Initial Values**.
