# **Reinforcement Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of **Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects** developed as part of the **Reinforcement Learning course** at the **National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA)**.  
Each project explores different RL algorithms and concepts, balancing **theoretical insights** with **practical implementation**.

Inspired by **Sutton and Barto’s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction**, these projects cover key areas such as **policy learning, value estimation, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs**.
