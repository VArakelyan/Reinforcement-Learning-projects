# Blackjack — Monte Carlo Methods (Sutton & Barto, Ch. 5)

This project reproduces and extends the Blackjack example from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Sutton & Barto (2nd Edition, Chapter 5).

It explores three core Monte Carlo techniques for control and prediction in model-free reinforcement learning:

- **Monte Carlo Exploring Starts (MC-ES)**  
- **On-Policy Monte Carlo Control with ε-greedy policy**  
- **Off-Policy Monte Carlo Prediction via Importance Sampling**

The environment mimics the episodic Blackjack setting described in the book:  
an infinite-deck game where the agent aims to learn an optimal strategy through sampled episodes of play.
