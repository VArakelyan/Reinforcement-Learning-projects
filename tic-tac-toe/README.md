**Reinforcement Learning Projects**
This repository contains multiple **Reinforcement Learning (R
L) projects**, each focusing on different environments, techni
ques, and learning strategies. The goal is to experiment with
RL concepts, build structured implementations, and improve my
understanding of **agent training, reward optimization, and de
cision-making in dynamic environments**.
**
##
Projects Overview**
Each project is organized in its own folder with a dedicated `
REA
DME.md`
explaining its objectives, methodology, and key fin
dings.

**Getting Started**
##
To explore any of the RL projects:
1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/VArakelyan/Reinforcement-Learning-projects
cd reinforcement-learning-projects
2. **
Navigate to a specific project folder**:
cd project-1
3. **
Install dependencies** (each project has its own requirem
ents.txt):
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the project**:
python main.py #
Or train.py depending on the project
**
Projects Included**
- **
Basic RL Implementations** – Foundational concepts applied
to simple environments.
- **
Agent Training** – Experiments with different reward struc
tures and learning policies.
- **Custom Environments** – Simulating unique scenarios for RL
models.
- **Evaluation and Optimization** – Analyzing performance and
tuning hyperparameters.
